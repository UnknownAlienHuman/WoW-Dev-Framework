# Third-party notice

`src/ketho.rs` ports the annotation behavior of Ketho/vscode-wow-api:
`luasrc/annotate/init.lua` and the naming helpers in `wowdoc/init.lua`.
`src/literals.rs` ports `luasrc/annotate/literals.lua` rendering, with
explicit formatting policies, deterministic ties and escaped string values.
The committed synthetic golden outputs are derived from that renderer.
